    <p>Have you ever gone on a surf trip, only to arrive in the place and realize that the surf spots are way beyond walking distance from your hotel? Have you ever seen the swell of the season pass you by, while you are stuck at home without a ride? How about being new in town and have no one to surf with? Tag Along is the answer to all these concerns. Invented to connect surfers, improve wave accessibility and make surfing more sustainable by sharing rides. Surfers are social beings.
