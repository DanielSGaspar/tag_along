# Tag Along

Tag Along is a web app that helps surfers without a car get to beaches around Lisbon. It also allows surfers with a car to save on costs by selling a seat on the ride to those beaches. This web app was created as the final project for a webdevelopment bootcamp at Le Wagon with my fellow colleagues shady-seal and tartari1993.

## Features
- Based on your location, the dashboard suggests beaches with rides where the pick-up location is close to your location.
- You can browse through the rides, check out their details, message the person offering the ride, and book the ride using Stripe for secure payments.
- The cards that display the beaches on the dashboard also use an API to display wind and swell conditions.
- You can create your own ride and offer seats to other surfers.

## Technologies

- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Multiple gems
- Mapbox API
- Cloudinary API
- Stormglass API
- Stripe API

## Known Issues

- The web app is not responsive yet and is only formatted for phones.
- The back button does not work intuitively; it merely takes you to the previous page, which can be problematic when you are two layers deep and want to go back to the dashboard. You would have to use the dashboard button in the burger menu.
- Location-based suggestions have some issues.

## Installation and Usage
As Tag Along is a web app, there is no need to install it. Simply go to the app's website and create an account to use it. You can browse available rides, book a seat, or offer a ride if you have a car. Please note that the seeds are limited. Currently there are rides from Lisbon until the 31st of March. Seeds will be updated. If you encounter any bugs or issues, please feel free to contact me through GitHub.

## Contributions

Currently, there is no plan to accept contributions to this project. If that changes, updates will be posted on the GitHub page.

Thank you for checking out Tag Along
